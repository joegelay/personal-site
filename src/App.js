      <p>I love to learn new things, solve problems, and connect people. 
        My background in marketing analytics has shaped me into being a detail-oriented thinker 
        with an eye for the big picture. 
        As a former Peace Corps Volunteer, I know how to work with ambiguity, 
        adapt to changes with grace, and communicate effectively to any team or audience. 
        When my eyes need a break from the screen, I like to climb rocks, run trails, and read books. </p>
