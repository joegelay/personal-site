      <h1>Hi, I'm Joe.</h1>
      <p>I love to learn new things, solve problems, and connect people. 
        My background in marketing has shaped me into being a detail-oriented thinker 
        that knows how to dissect big challenges into actionable objectives. 
        As a former Peace Corps Volunteer, I know how to work with ambiguity, 
        adapt to changes with grace, and communicate effectively to any team or audience. 
        When my eyes need a break from the screen, I like to climb rocks, run trails, and read books. </p>
