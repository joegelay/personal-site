# JoeGelay.com

One of my favorite quotes is from Leonardo da Vinci who said, "Simplicity is the ultimate sophisitication". I value minimalism in many areas of my life, and wanted to create a personal site to reflect that. 
<br />
<br />
The site is built with React.js, React Router, and CSS.

- 'Writing' page uses Medium API to stay up-to-date with all my technical writing.
- 'Readng' page makes use of a Goodreads widget to show the 10 latest books I've read.
